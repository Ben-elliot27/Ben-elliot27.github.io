"On a scale of 1 to 5, how well did you understand the rules of the card game? (With 5 being the highest)","On a scale of 1 to 5, how likely would you recommend this card game to your peers? (With 5 being the highest)",,Which specific cards or mechanics were most helpful in understanding particle physics concepts? (Rank in order of preference),Any other comments about the game? Or having the game as part of the masterclass?,,,

4,5,3,Force carrier interactions ;The charge conjugation of the ‘flip’ ;Quark and lepton labelling ;Parts of the detector that detect particles;,"A card that swaps hands would help to prevent hand stagnation, also Higgs boson would be less OP if it could only be played on massive particles, also gluons should be required for hadron formation (or limit hadron formation otherwise, like no charmed or bottom hadrons). Overall though, it's a great game and I can totally see the particle physicists of the next generation playing it today!",,,
