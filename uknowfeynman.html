          <p>
            Feynman UNO Flip is an educational card game that brings the complexities of particle physics to life through interactive gameplay. Originally developed as a physical card game for a university project in collaboration with lecturers, researchers, and UCL Business, this virtual version aims to make the game accessible to a broader audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired by the interactive sessions held with GCSE and A-Level students, this online version allows players to learn particle physics concepts anywhere in the world.

        <h2>Game Rules</h2>
        <p>The game follows a set of unique rules inspired by particle physics principles:</p>
        <ul class="rules__list">
          <li><strong>Color and Particle Matching:</strong> Players can play a card that matches the color or particle type of the current card.</li>
          <li><strong>Boson Rule:</strong> When a boson card is played, the next card must be of the same class as the bottom card.</li>
          <li><strong>Weak Boson/Photon Rule:</strong> Cards can be played as long as charge conservation holds, and the particle is not a boson.</li>
          <li><strong>Gluon Rule:</strong> When a gluon is played, the next card must match the particle type exactly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Known Issues and TODOs</h2>
        <ul class="issues__list">
          <li><strong>Animations:</strong> Implement card animations for smoother gameplay.</li>
          <li><strong>Flip Mechanic:</strong> Currently, flipping doesn't affect other players' views. This might become a feature.</li>
          <li><strong>Card Highlighting:</strong> When flipping locally, the highlight on cards may not persist.</li>
          <li><strong>Interactive Instructions:</strong> Improve in-game instructions.</li>
          <li><strong>Card Positioning on iOS:</strong> Fix card positioning issues on iOS devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Game Manager:</strong> Add a game manager feature for better control over game sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Button Edge Cases:</strong> Address edge cases related to button press timings.</li>
          <li><strong>Playing and Drawing on a H card:</strong> Sometimes the first click when drawing on a Higgs card draws too many cards. Need to delay time spans between cards being drawn on a Higgs to signify what is happening.</li>
          <li><strong>Game Resetting:</strong> Other players visually don't reset correctly - still shows other players as the same amount of cards as before, however this updates as soon as any action is taken (visual update not called when resetting game).</li>
          <li><strong>Multi-Play Error Messages:</strong> Get an error message saying not your turn when trying multi-play. This should not happen, but does not affect gameplay.</li>
        </ul>
