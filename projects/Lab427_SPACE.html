        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <div class="project__content">
          <p>
            This VR software project was developed by <b>Dr. Stephen Hilton</b>, an Associate Professor at the UCL School of Pharmacy, to revolutionize the way physics is taught and learned. The software immerses users in a fully interactive space environment, allowing them to navigate a spaceship, explore breathtaking black holes, and experience wormhole traversal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The project began when a group of UCL physics students, including myself, approached Dr. Hilton for access to VR headsets for testing other software. Inspired by our interest, Dr. Hilton started creating this VR tool. Our group then contributed by developing educational content, character sheets for AI avatars, and 3D video of the Ellis wormhole traversal.

            The project was initiated by <b>Dr. Stephen Hilton</b>, leveraging his extensive experience in VR and educational technology. My physics group contributed significantly by creating content and educational materials, including developing character sheets for AI avatars, generating the 3D video of the Ellis wormhole traversal, and producing educational videos on wormhole traversal.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Mark Fuller</b>, Head of UCL Physics Outreach, has since joined the project, coordinating playtests of the software. I have been deeply involved in these playtests, suggesting further developments and helping run the software during demonstrations.
